        <p style="font-family:times new roman;font-size: x-large;color: #000000">Much to her surprise, Blair Willows, the young waitress with a heart of gold, discovers that she is accepted at Gardania's prestigious Princess Charm School, where girls can train to become princesses or royal ladies. As Blair learns the ways of a proper princess, the academy's imperious teacher, Dame Devin, realises that the beautiful young woman resembles a lot the realm's missing heiress to the throne--a title she intends for her daughter, Delancy. Could Blair be Gardania's true queen?</p>
